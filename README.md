# Typing Race Game

The application is a simple typing game that tracks the user's typing speed - written in Python using the Pygame library.

## Playing the Game

Starting the game gets us here - as soon as the bar is clicked the timer is started:

When you correctly finish typing the line of text this is presented - the man runs to the end of the finishing line as more of the line is correctly typed:

## Reflection

The biggest challenge of the program was understanding the relationship between the front-end and back-end of the game. I learned a lot about user interfaces and understanding how the user interacts with the program in order for the program to work as intended. I am continuing to make changes to this as I develop the program further.

## Installation

1. Firstly install a python interpreter
2. Download the source files from github
3. Run TypingGamev1.py
